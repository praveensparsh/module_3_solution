  <div class="col-xs-12"> The three regions of Andhra Pradesh have variations in the cuisine. Telangana region shares border with Central Indian and Vidharba, this area has more jowar- and bajra-based rotis in their staple diet.
The Rayalaseema district shares borders with eastern Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and its cuisine has similarities to that of those regions.The more fertile Andhra coastal region has a long coastline along the Bay of Bengal, and its cuisine has a distinctive flavor with various seafood. Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh, has its own characteristic cuisine, which is considerably different from other Andhra cuisines. The Nizams patronise the Hyderabadi cuisine, which is very much like the Nawabi and Lucknowi cuisine. The only difference is that the Nizams of Hyderabad prefer their food to be spicier, resulting in the distinct Hyderabadi cuisine, which includes delicacies like Kacche gosht (Raw Meat) ki biryani, Dum ka Murgh (Chicken cooked in Hyderabadi Style), baghara baingan (Eggplant), and Achaari Subzi (Vegetable gravy with the taste of pickles).In North Karnataka, the staple grains are sorghum and pearl millet, along with rice. Rottis made out of these two grains, along with side dishes made of eggplant, fresh spiced salads of vegetables sometimes with raw lentils, spiced and stewed lentils are popular and routinely eaten. North Karnataka people also consume a variety of spicy condiments including chutney powders (Shenga pudi, Gurol pudi, agasi pudi, yellu chatni pudi), raw chutneys and pickles. Of all the other regional cuisines in Karnataka, this is known for its fiery spice level and heat. Eateries called Khanavali, often run by families, serve inexpensive but tasty home-style food. Most of them are run by Veerashaiva and are vegetarian, but Khanavalis serving non-vegetarian food are not uncommon. North Karnataka is one such geographical area in India with a lower per capita consumption of meat.The cuisine of coastal Karnataka is marked by widespread use of seafood, coconut and coconut oil. Rice is the staple grain and is the centerpiece of every meal. Gravies called "gassi" made from chicken, fish, meats are served with rice. Lentils and vegetables cooked with coconut, spices and tempered with mustard, curry leaves, and generous asafoetida, in a dish called huli, is also served with rice. A rasam-like preparation called Saaru, is also served with rice. The meal will also contain vegetable side dishes called palya. Other accompaniments include curd-based tambli, sweet-tangy gojju, pickles and happala, sandige(fryums) or papads. Some of the distinct breakfast foods served here include bun, biscuit rotti, goli bajji, and patrode.
